# To-Do List Web App

Welcome to the To-Do List Web App! This application was initially created following a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0jO8kUrg-I&pp=ygUXdG8gZG8gbGlzdCBhcHAgaHRtbCBjc3M%3D) by [GreatStack](https://www.youtube.com/@GreatStackDev). A big shout out to them for providing the inspiration.
